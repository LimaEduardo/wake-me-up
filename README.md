# wake-me-up

I lost my phone and need to wake up tomorrow early, so a made this script to wake me up in the morning. 

I'm going to wake up to the sound of the most clich√© music for alarm clocks. U2 - Beautiful Day (i don't even like this music)

In case you're stupid like me and lost your phone, you can run this script with Nodejs. This script will open Google Chrome in Youtube in a hour of your choice.

To use this, just run

```
node WakeMeUp.js <hour-that-you-need-to-wakeup>
```

like this

```
node WakeMeUp.js 08:00
```

This script uses the 24-hour clock
